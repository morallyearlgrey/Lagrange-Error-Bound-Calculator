**AP Calculus BC Final Project: Lagrange Error Bound Calculator**

**Summary**
Implemented in Python, this Lagrange error bound calculator calculates the error in Taylor polynomials in relation to the actual functions. As this project was created to satisfy an end-of-the-year project in AP Calculus BC, it provides answers to two given word problems and does not request user input. 

**Overview of Features:**
- User-friendly display
- Accurate and precise
- Showcases specific examples of implementation

**Instructions:**
1) Does not require any input and only needs to be ran
